Intro
My talk is on Vagrant Virtual Machines, provisioning of the same using Ansible an attempt towards making team scaling and ramp ups less painful and reduce the initial dip in productivity.

Common Problems faced with team expansion
Team expansions always lead to initial drop of productivity. There are a lot of problems whenever new members join the team. The team productivity may increase after all the new joinees have been induced to what the team has been working on and once they are made capable to contribute to the project. But the enablement part is the most painful part, and does eat up a lot of utilisation. 

Setting up the development environment
So when new developers join the team, before they can start with understanding the codebase, their development environments need to be setup. Now they cannot even start with understanding the codebase until their development environment is setup, and they can see the application working on their computer.
